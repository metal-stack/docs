# Cluster API

[Cluster API](https://cluster-api.sigs.k8s.io/) is a Kubernetes project that aims to simplify the management of Kubernetes clusters. It provides a declarative way to create, configure, and manage clusters using Kubernetes-style APIs.

We provide the [Cluster API provider for metal-stack (CAPMS)](https://github.com/metal-stack/cluster-api-provider-metal-stack) infrastructure provider that allows the declaration of Kubernetes clusters.

> [!CAUTION]
> This project is currently under heavy development and is not advised to be used in production any time soon.
> Please use our stack on top of [Gardener](./gardener.md) for production workloads.

Due to the early development stage of the project, all docs are currently in the [README](https://github.com/metal-stack/cluster-api-provider-metal-stack/blob/main/README.md) of the provider repository.
