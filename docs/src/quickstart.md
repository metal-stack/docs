# Getting Started

Before starting to buy any expensive hardware, you should try out the metal-stack on your notebook and familiarize with all the major principles.

For this, we made the [mini-lab](https://github.com/metal-stack/mini-lab).

The mini-lab is a fully virtual setup and is supposed to be run on a single notebook. For this reason, the setup is slightly simplified in comparison to full-blown setups on real hardware. However, the lab should help to understand all major ideas and components of the metal-stack.
