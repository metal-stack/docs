# Kubernetes Integration

With the help of the [Gardener](https://gardener.cloud/) project, metal-stack can be used for spinning up Kubernetes clusters quickly and reliably on bare metal machines.

## Kubernetes related components

### metal-ccm

### csi-lvm

## Gardener related components

## gardener-extension-provider-metal

## os-metal-extension
