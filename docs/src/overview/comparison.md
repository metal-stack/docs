# Comparison with Commercial Solutions

As metal-stack is the foundation to build Kubernetes clusters on premise on bare metal, there are several commercial solutions available which offer management of Kubernetes.
In this document we describe the differences between some of the most popular solutions. ItÂ´s is not a complete list.

Comparison between Gardener on Metal Stack and Openshift running on VMWare.

## Gardener

[Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) is a Kubernetes cluster manager to organize a fleet of Kubernetes clusters at scale. It is designed to scale to thousands of clusters at a variety of IaaS Providers regardless where - in the cloud or on premise, virtualized or bare metal.
It not only manages the creation and deletion of Kubernetes clusters, it also takes care of updating or upgrading Kubernetes and the operating system of the involved worker nodes in a automatic manner. Gardener is designed cloud-native and as such, it defines clusters, workers and all other components as Kubernetes resources (like pods and deployments) and reconciles these resources to the desired state.

## Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is the de facto open-source standard for container scheduling and orchestration in the data center.

## Openshift

A fork of Kubernetes with proprietary addons, created by RedHat. For all details see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift).

## metal-stack

Is an [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service) provider for bare metal focused to create Kubernetes cluster on premise. Gardener support is built in.

## VMWare

The most used virtualization technology in the enterprise data centers.
