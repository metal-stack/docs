# Comparison with commercial Solutions

As metal-stack is the foundation to build kubernetes clusters on premise on bare metal, there are several commercial solutions available which offer management of kubernetes.
In this document we describe the difference of some of the most popular solutions. ItÂ´s is not a complete list.

In this document we want to compare a often cited battle between Kubernetes managed by Gardener on Metal Stack and Openshift running on VMWare.

## Gardener

[Gardener](https://gardener.cloud) is a Kubernetes Cluster manager to organize a fleet of Kubernetes Clusters at Scale. It is designed to scale to thousands of clusters at a variety of IaaS Providers regardles where, in the Cloud or On Premise, virtualized or bare metal.
It manages not only the creation and deletion of a Kubernetes Cluster, it also takes care of updates and upgrades of kubernetes and the Operating System of the involved Worker Nodes in a automatic Manner. Its designed Cloud Native as it defines Clustes, Workers and all other Components like Pods and Deployments as Kubernetes Resources which are reconciled to the desired state.

## Kubernetes

[Kubernetes](https://kubernetes.io) is the de facto Open Source standard for Container Scheduling and Orchestration in the Datacenter.

## Openshift

A Fork of Kubernetes with proprietary addons, created by RedHat. For all Details see: [https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenShift).

## Metal Stack

Is a [IaaS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrastructure_as_a_service) provider for bare metal focused to create Kubernetes Cluster On Premise. Gardener support is built in.

## VMWare

The most used virtualization technology in the Enterprise Datacenters.
