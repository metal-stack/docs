# Planning Meetings

We maintain a public board for planning development tasks in metal-stack on GitHub: https://github.com/orgs/metal-stack/projects/34.

The planning board is updated during public, biweekly planning meetings on Microsoft Teams.

The purpose of the meetings is to discuss and prioritize issues and pull requests. They can also be used to present new ideas or upcoming topics. Overall, these meetings improve communication among metal-stack contributors and address their concerns about the project's direction.

| Date                              | Title             | Link  |

Planning meetings are currently not recorded. The meetings are held either in English or German depending on the attendees.

!!! info

    Note that anyone can contribute to metal-stack without participating in planning meetings. However, if you want to speed up the review process for your requirements, it might be helpful to attend the meetings.

## Idea Backlog

The backlog contains ideas of what could become part of the roadmap in the future. The list is ordered alphabetically. Therefore, the order does not express the importance or weight of a backlog item.

We incorporate community feedback into the roadmap. If you think that important points are missing in the backlog, please share your ideas with us. We have a Slack channel. Please check out [metal-stack.io](https://metal-stack.io) for contact information.

!!! danger

    By no means this list is a promise of what is being worked on in the near future. It is just a summary of ideas that was agreed on to be "nice to have". It is up to the investors, maintainers and the community to choose topics from this list and to implement them or to remove them from the list.
