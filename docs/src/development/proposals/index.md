# Metal Stack Enhancement Proposals (MEPs)

This section contains proposals which address substantial modifications to metal-stack.

Every proposal has a short name which starts with *MEP* followed by an incremental, unique number. Proposals should be raised as pull requests in the [docs](https://github.com/metal-stack/docs) repository and can be discussed in Github issues.

The list of proposal and their current state is listed in the table below.

Possible states are:

- `In Discussion`
- `Accepted`
- `Declined`
- `In Progress`
- `Paused`
- `Completed`

Once a proposal was accepted, an issue should be raised and the implementation should be done in a separate PR.
