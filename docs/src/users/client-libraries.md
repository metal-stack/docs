# Client Libraries

Our public-facing APIs are built on [swagger](https://swagger.io/), which allows you generating API clients in all sorts of programming languages.

For the [metal-api](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-api) we officially support the following client libraries:

- [metal-go](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-go)
- [metal-python](https://github.com/metal-stack/metal-python)
