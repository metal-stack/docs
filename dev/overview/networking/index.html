New technologies have been evaluated to apply the best solutions. The process was heavily inspired by the work of Dinesh G. Dutt regarding BGP (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/border-gateway-protocol/">bgp-ebook</a>) and EVPN (<a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/evpn-ebook/">evpn-ebook</a>).</p><p>External BGP together with network overlay concepts as EVPN can address the essential demands. These revolutionary concepts are part of the next evolutionary step in data center design. It overcomes common issues of traditional layer 2 architectures (e.g. VLAN limitations, network visibility for operations, firewall requirements) by introducing a layer 3 based network topology.</p><h3 id="CLOS"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#CLOS">CLOS</a><a id="CLOS-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#CLOS" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>A CLOS topology is named after the pioneer Charles Clos (short: <strong>CLOS</strong>) who first formalized this approach. CLOS defines a multistage network topology that is used today to improve performance and resilience while enabling a cost effective scalability. A CLOS topology comprises network switches aggregated into spine and leaf layers. Each leaf switch (short: <strong>leaf</strong>) is connected to all spine switches (short: <strong>spine</strong>) but there is no direct leaf-to-leaf or spine-to-spine connection (See: picture 1).</p><p><img src="../2-layer-leaf-spine.svg" alt="2 Layer CLOS Topology"/></p><blockquote><p>Picture 1: Fragment of CLOS to show leaf-spine layer.</p></blockquote><p>This data center network architecture, based on a leaf-spine architecture, is also know as &quot;two-tier&quot; CLOS topology.</p><p><img src="../3-layer-leaf-spine.svg" alt="3 Layer CLOS Topology"/></p><blockquote><p>Picture 2: Fragment to show a 3-stage, 2-layer CLOS topology.</p></blockquote><p>Tenant servers are dual-attached to the leaf layer in order to have redundancy and load balancing capability (Picture 2). The set of leaves, spine switches and tenant servers define stages. From top down each server is reachable with 3 hops (spine -&gt; leaf -&gt; server). This is why that CLOS design is called a 3-stage CLOS. Consistent latency throughout the data center are an outcome of this design.</p><p>It is not only important to have a scalable and resilient infrastructure but also to support planning and operation teams. Visibility within the network is of significant meaning for them. Consequently layer-3 routing in favor of layer-2 bridging provides this kind of tooling.</p><h3 id="BGP"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#BGP">BGP</a><a id="BGP-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#BGP" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>For routing the <strong>Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)</strong>, more specific: External BGP was selected. Extensive testing and operational experiences have shown that External BGP is well suited as a stand-alone routing protocol (see: <a href="https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7938">RFC7938</a>).</p><p>Not all tenant servers are connected to the same leaf. Instead they can be distributed among any of the leaves of the data center. To not let this detail restrict the intra-tenant communication it is required to interconnect those layer-2 domains. In the context of BGP there is a concept of overlay networking with VXLAN/ EVPN that was evaluated to satisfy the needs of the metal-stack.</p><h4 id="BGP-Unnumbered"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#BGP-Unnumbered">BGP Unnumbered</a><a id="BGP-Unnumbered-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#BGP-Unnumbered" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>In BGP traditionally each BGP peer-facing interface requires a separate IPv4 address. This consumes a lot of IP addresses. RFC 5549 defines the BGP unnumbered standard. It allows to use interface&#39;s IPv6 link local address (LLA) to set up a BGP session with a peer. With BGP unnumbered the IPv6 LLA of the remote is automatically discovered via Router Advertisement (RA) protocol. Important: This does not (!) mean that IPv6 must be deployed in the network. BGP uses RFC 5549 to encode IPv4 routes as reachable over IPv6 next-hop using the LLA. Having unnumbered interfaces does not mean no IPv4 address may be in place. It is a good practice to configure an IP address to the never failing and always present local loopback interface (lo). This lo address is reachable over BGP from other peers because the RFC 5549 standard provides an encoding scheme to allow a router to advertise IPv4 routes with an IPv6 next-hop. BGP unnumbered also has an advantage from security perspective. It removes IPv4 and global IPv6 addresses from router interfaces, thus reducing the attack vector.</p><p>To sum it up:</p><ul><li>BGP unnumbered uses IPv6 next-hops to announce IPv4 routes.</li><li>There is no IPv6 deployment in the network required.</li><li>IPv6 just has to be enabled on the BGP peers to provide LLA and RA.</li></ul><p>In BGP, ASN is how BGP peers know each other.</p><h4 id="ASN-Numbering"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#ASN-Numbering">ASN Numbering</a><a id="ASN-Numbering-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#ASN-Numbering" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Within the data center each BGP router is identified by a private autonomous system number (ASN). This ASN is used for internal communication. The default is to have 2-byte ASN. To avoid having to find workarounds in case the ASN address space is exhausted, a 4-byte ASN that supports up to 95 million ASNs (4200000000–4294967294) is used from the beginning.</p><p>ASN numbering in a CLOS topology should follow a model to avoid routing problems (path hunting) due to it&#39;s redundant nature. Within a CLOS topology the following ANS numbering model is suggested to solve path hunting problems:</p><ul><li>Leaves have unique ASN</li><li>Spines share an ASN</li><li>Exit switches share an ASN</li></ul><h4 id="Address-Families"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Address-Families">Address-Families</a><a id="Address-Families-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Address-Families" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>As stated, BGP is a multi-protocol routing protocol. Since it is planned to use IPv4 and overlay networks using EVPN/VXLAN several address-families have to be activated for the BGP sessions to use:</p><ul><li>IPv4 unicast address-family</li><li>L2 EVPN address-family</li></ul><h3 id="EVPN"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#EVPN">EVPN</a><a id="EVPN-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#EVPN" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Ethernet VPN (EVPN) is an overlay virtual network that connects layer-2 segments over layer-3 infrastructure. EVPN is an answer to common problems of entire layer-2 data centers.</p><h4 id="Why-do-we-need-EVPN"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Why-do-we-need-EVPN">Why do we need EVPN</a><a id="Why-do-we-need-EVPN-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Why-do-we-need-EVPN" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Challenges such as large failure domains, spanning tree complexities, difficult troubleshooting and scaling issues are addressed by EVPN:</p><ul><li><strong>administration</strong>: less routers are involved in configuration (with VLAN every switch on routing-paths needs VLAN awareness). The configuration is less error prone due to the nature of EVPN and the good support in FRR.</li><li><strong>scaling</strong>: EVPN overcomes scaling issues with traditional VLANs (max. 4094 VLANs).</li><li><strong>cost-effectiveness</strong>: EVPN is an overlay virtual network. Not every switch on the routing path needs EVPN awareness. This enables the use of standard routers (in contrast to traditional VLAN); e.g.: spine switches act only as evpn information replicator and do not need to have knowledge of specific virtual networks.</li><li><strong>efficiency</strong>: EVPN information is exclusively exchanged via BGP (Multiprotocol BGP). Only a single eBGP session is needed to advertise layer-2 reachability. No other protocols beneath BGP are involved and flood traffic is reduced to a minimum (no &quot;flood-and-learn&quot;, no BUM traffic).</li></ul><p>Virtual routing permits multiple network paths without the need of multiple switches. Hence the servers are logically isolated by assigning their networks to dedicated virtual routers using virtual routing and forwarding (short: <strong>VRF</strong>).</p><h4 id="How-do-we-use-EVPN"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#How-do-we-use-EVPN">How do we use EVPN</a><a id="How-do-we-use-EVPN-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#How-do-we-use-EVPN" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>EVPN (technology) is based on BGP as control plane protocol (underlay) and VXLAN as data plane protocol (overlay).</p><p>As EVPN is an overlay network, only the VXLAN Tunnel End Points (VTEPs) must be configured. In the case of two-tier CLOS networks leaf switches are tunnel endpoints.</p><p>In EVPN routing is assumed to occur in the context of a VRF. VRF enables true multitenancy. Therewith, VRF is the first step for EVPN configuration and there is a 1:1 relationship between tenant and VRF.</p><p>To enable layer-2 connectivity, we need a special interface to route between layer-2 networks. This interface is called Switched VLAN Interface (SVI). The SVI is realized with a VLAN. It is part of a VRF (layer-3).</p><p>The VTEP configuration requires the setup of a VXLAN interface. A VLAN aware bridge interconnects the VXLAN interface and the SVI.</p><p>Required Interfaces to establish the EVPN control plane:</p><ul><li>VRF: because routing happens in the context of this interface.</li><li>SVI: because remote host routes for symmetric routing are installed over this interface.</li><li>VLAN-aware bridge: because router MAC addresses of remote VTEPs are installed over this interface.</li><li>VXLAN Interface / VXLAN Tunnel Endpoint: because the VRF to layer-3 VNI mapping has to be consistent across all VTEPs)</li></ul><p><img src="../evpn-vtep.svg" alt="EVPN VTEP"/></p><blockquote><p>Picture 3: Required interfaces on the switch to wire up the vrf to swp 1 connectivity with a given vxlan</p></blockquote><p>Integrated routing and bridging (IRB) is the most complex part of EVPN. You could choose between centralized or distributed routing, and between asymmetrical (routing on ingress) or symmetrical (routing on ingress and egress) routing. We expect a lot of traffic within the data center itself which implies the need to avoid zigzag routing. This is why we go with distributed routing model. Further it is recommended to use the symmetric model since it makes the cut in most cases and has advantages in scalability (see &quot;EVPN in the Data Center&quot;, Dinesh G. Dutt).</p><h3 id="MTU"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#MTU">MTU</a><a id="MTU-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#MTU" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>In a layer-3 network it is important to associate each interface with a proper Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) to avoid fragmentation of IP packets. Typical modern networks do not fragment IP packets and the introduction of VXLAN adds another additional header to the packets that must not exceed the MTU. If the MTU is exceeded, VXLAN might just fail without error as Cumulus consultants stated. This already represents a difficult-to-diagnose connectivity issue that has to be avoided.</p><p>It is common practice to set the MTU for VXLAN facing interfaces (e.g. inter-switch links) to a value of <code>9216</code> to compensate the additional VXLAN overhead and an MTU of <code>9000</code> as a default to other interfaces (e.g. server facing ports). The common MTU of <code>1500</code> is not sufficient for traffic inside a data center!</p><h3 id="VRF"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#VRF">VRF</a><a id="VRF-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#VRF" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Routing is needed for communication between VXLAN tunnels or between a VXLAN tunnel and an external networks. VXLAN routing supports layer-3 multi-tenancy. All routing occurs in the context of a VRF. There is a 1:1 relation of a VRF to a tenant. Picture 3 illustrates this. Servers A and B belong to the same vrf VRF1. Server C is enslaved into VRF2. There is no communication possible between members of VRF1 and those of VRF2.</p><p><img src="../vrf-simple.svg" alt="Two routing tables"/></p><blockquote><p>Picture 4: Illustration of two distinct routing tables of VRF1 (enslaved: servers A and B) and VRF2 (enslaved: server C)</p></blockquote><p>To leaverage the potential and power of BGP, VRF, EVPN/VXLAN without a vendor lock-in the implementation relies on hardware that is supported by open network operating system: Cumulus Linux.</p><h2 id="Implementation"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Implementation">Implementation</a><a id="Implementation-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Implementation" title="Permalink"></a></h2><p>Implementation of the network operation requires the data center infrastructure to be in place.

In case those tenant servers require access to or from external networks, a new tenant server to function as a firewall is created. Leaf and spine switches form the fundament of the CLOS network to facilitate redundancy, resilience and scalability. Exit switches establish connectivity to or from external networks. Management Switch and Management Server are mandatory parts that build a management network to access the network switches for administration.</p><p>To operate the CLOS topology, software defined configuration to enable BGP, VRF, EVPN and VXLAN must be set up.</p><h3 id="Network-Operating-Systems"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Network-Operating-Systems">Network Operating Systems</a><a id="Network-Operating-Systems-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Network-Operating-Systems" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Cumulus Linux as the network operating system will be installed on all network switches (leaves, spines, exit switches) within the CLOS topology.

This is a marker that enables compile-time provided settings that e.g. set specific values for BGP session timers. This is followed by a directive to state that instead of several configuration files for different purposes a single <em>frr.conf</em> file is used: <code>service integrated-vtysh-config</code>. The two interface specific blocks starting with <code>interface ...</code> enable the RA mechanism that is required for BGP unnumbered peer discovery. There is a global BGP instance configuration <code>router bgp 4200000001</code> that sets the private ASN. The BGP router configuration contains a setup that identifies the BGP speaker <code>bgp router-id 10.0.0.1</code>. This router id should be unique. It is a good practice to assign the local loopback IPv4 as router-id. To apply the same configuration to several interfaces a peer group named <code>TOR</code> is defined via <code>neighbor TOR peer-group</code>. <code>remote-as external</code> activates external BGP for this peer group. To have a fast convergence, limits of default timers are reduced by <code>timer 1 3</code> section. The two BGP-peer-facing interfaces are enslaved into the peer-group to inherit the peer-group&#39;s setup. Activation of IPv4 unicast protocol is completed with <code>address-family ipv4 unicast</code>. To prevent a tenant server from announcing other paths than <code>lo</code> interface a route-map <code>only-self-out</code> is defined. This route map is activated within the ipv4 address family: <code>neighbor TOR route-map only-self-out out</code>.</p><p>Application of the route map <code>only-self-out</code> enables to announce only local ip(s). This is to avoid that a tenant server announces paths to other servers (prevents unwanted traffic). To achieve this:</p><ul><li><p>the route-map named <code>only-self-out</code> permits only matches against an access list named <code>SELF</code></p></li><li><p>access list <code>SELF</code> permits only empty path announcements</p></li><li><p>the path of the tenant server itself has no ASN. It is always empty (see line <code>*&gt; 10.0.0.2/32 0.0.0.0 0 32768 ?</code>):</p><pre><code class="language-bash hljs">root@machine:~# vtysh -c &#39;show bgp ipv4 unicast&#39;

Displayed  4 routes and 7 total paths</code></pre><p>That is why only the self ip (looback ip) is announced.</p></li></ul><p>To allow for peering between FRR and other routing daemons on a tenant server a <code>listen range</code> is specified to accept iBGP sessions on the network <code>10.244.0.0/16</code>. Therewith it gets possible that pods / containers like metal-lb with IPs of this range may peer with FRR.</p><p>This is the only place where we use iBGP in our topology. For local peering this has the advantage, that we don&#39;t need an additional ASN that has to be handled / pruned in the AS-path of routes. Routes coming from other routing daemons look as if they are configured on the tenant server&#39;s lo interface from the viewpoint of the leaves. iBGP routes are differently handled than eBGP routes in BGPs best path algorithm. Generally BGP has the rule to prefer eBGP routes over iBGP routes (s. <a href="https://medium.com/netdevops/how-bgp-best-path-selection-works-80e6e7b2da2b">&#39;eBGP over iBGP&#39;</a> ). BGP adds automatically an weight based on the route type. To overcome this issue, we set the weight of iBGP routes to the same weight that eBGP routes have, namely 32768 (<code>set weight 32768</code>). Without this configuration we will only get a single route to the IPs announced via iBGP. So this setting is essential for HA/failover!</p><p>Statistics of the established BGP session can be viewed locally from the tenant server via: <code>sudo vtysh -c &#39;show bgp ipv4 unicast&#39;</code></p><p>To establish this BGP session a BGP setup is required on the leaves as well.</p><h4 id="Leaf-Setup"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Leaf-Setup">Leaf Setup</a><a id="Leaf-Setup-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Leaf-Setup" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>Every leaf switch is connected to every spine switch. Tenant servers can be distributed within the data center and thus be connected to different leaves. Routing for tenant servers is isolated in unique VRFs. These constraints imply several configuration requirements for the leaf and spine switches:</p><ul><li>leaves define tenant VRFs</li><li>leaves terminate VXLAN tunnels (aka &quot;VXLAN tunnel endpoint&quot; = VTEP)</li></ul><p>The leaf setup requires the definition of a tenant VRF that enslaves the tenant server facing interfaces:</p><pre><code class="language-bash hljs"># /etc/network/interfaces

To send and receive packets of a VRF, several interface are in place.</p><p>A bridge is used to attach VXLAN interface <code>bridge-ports vni3981</code> and map its local VLAN to a VNI. Router MAC addresses of remote VTEPs are installed over this interface.</p><p>The Routed VLAN Interface or Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) <code>iface vlan1001</code> is configured corresponding to the per-tenant VXLAN interface. It is attached to the tenant VRF. Remote host routes are installed over this SVI. The <code>vlan-raw-device bridge</code> is used to associate the SVI with the VLAN aware bridge. For a packet received from a locally attached host the SVI interface corresponding to the VLAN determines the VRF <code>vrf vrf3981</code>.</p><p>The VXLAN interface <code>iface vni3981</code> defines a tunnel address that is used for the VXLAN tunnel header <code>vlxan-local-tunnelip 10.0.0.11</code>. This VTEP IP address is typically the loopback device address of the switch. When EVPN is provisioned, data plane MAC learning for VXLAN interfaces must be disabled because the purpose of EVPN is to exchange MACs between VTEPs in the control plane: <code>bridge-learning off</code>. EVPN is responsible for installing remote MACs. <code>bridge-arp-nd-suppress</code> suppresses ARP flooding over VXLAN tunnels.  Instead, a local proxy handles ARP requests received from locally attached hosts for remote hosts. ARP suppression is the implementation for IPv4; ND suppression is the implementation for IPv6. It is recommended by Cumulus to enable ARP suppression on all VXLAN interfaces. Bridge Protocol Data Unit (BPDU) are not transmitted over VXLAN interfaces. So as a good practice bpduguard and pbdufilter are enabled with <code>mstpctl-bpduguard yes</code> and <code>mstpctl-portbpdufilter yes</code>. These settings filter BPDU and guard the spanning tree topology from unauthorized switches affecting the forwarding path. <code>vxlan-id 3981</code> specifies the VXLAN Network Identifier (VNI). The type of VNI can either be layer-2 (L2) or layer-3 (L3). This is an implicit thing. A VNI is a L3 VNI (L3VNI) when a mapping exists that maps the VNI to a VRF (configured in <code>/etc/frr/frr.conf</code>) otherwise it is a L2 VNI (L2VNI).</p><pre><code class="language-bash hljs"># /etc/frr/frr.conf

Only content not discussed so far is explained. The section <code>vrf vrf3981</code> contains the mapping from layer-3 VNI to VRF. This is required to be able to install EVPN IP prefix routes (type-5 routes) into the routing table. Further the file contains a global BGP instance <code>router bgp 4200000011</code> definition. A new setting <code>redistribute connected route-map LOOPBACKS</code> is in place to filter the redistribution of routes that are not matching the local loopback interface. The route-map is defined with <code>route-map LOOPBACKS permit 10</code>. With the configuration line  <code>address-family l2vpn evpn</code>, the EVPN address family is enabled between BGP neighbours. <code>advertise-all-vni</code> makes the switch a VTEP configures it in such a way, that all locally configured VNIs should be advertised by the BGP control plane.</p><p>The second BGP instance configuration is specific to the tenant VRF <code>router bgp 4200000011 vrf vrf3981</code>. This VRF BGP instance configures the l2vpn evpn address family with <code>advertise ipv4 unicast</code> to announce IP prefixes in BGP&#39;s routing information base (RIB). This is required to apply learned routes to the routing tables of connected hosts. The Maximum-Prefix feature is useful to avoid that a router recieves more routes than the router memory can take. The maximum number of prefixes a tenant server is allowed to announce is limited to <code>100</code> with: <code>neighbor MACHINE maximum-prefix 100</code>.</p><h4 id="Spine-setup"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Spine-setup">Spine setup</a><a id="Spine-setup-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Spine-setup" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>On the spine switches the setup is quite simple. <code>/etc/network/interfaces</code> contains the loopback interface definition to support BGP unnumbered and listings for connected switch ports to provide proper MTUs (Listing 6).

There is a different latency to each of these routers. To favor routes of exit nodes connected with lower latency over exit nodes with higher latency two route maps <code>PREPEND-PATH-TO-DISFAVOR-IN</code> and <code>PREPEND-PATH-TO-DISFAVOR-OUT</code> are added to high latency exit nodes. These route maps apply actions to prolong the path of the incoming and outgoing routes. Because of this path extension BGP will calculate a lower weight for these paths and favors paths via other exit nodes. It is important to know that within an address family only one route map (the last) will be applied. To apply more than one actions within a route-map the required entries can be applied to a single route-map.</p><h4 id="Operationalizing-Cumulus-Linux"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Operationalizing-Cumulus-Linux">Operationalizing Cumulus Linux</a><a id="Operationalizing-Cumulus-Linux-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Operationalizing-Cumulus-Linux" title="Permalink"></a></h4><p>With Cumulus Linux as the basic network operating system there are two possibilities on how to get configuration into the target devices:</p><ol><li>editing flat files and reloading required services</li><li>utilizing Network Command Line Utility (NCLU)</li></ol><p>The NCLU has two wrappers:</p><ol><li>CLI (<code>net</code> command)</li><li>Ansible Module <code>nclu</code></li></ol><p>As Cumulus states, the NCLU tool is intended for people who do not understand Linux. Besides the fact, that we understand that editing flat files has advantages, we found the following reasons to stick with this approach:</p><ul><li>full control on what is going on and when it is going on</li><li>no suffer from bugs that are present in NCLU <code>net</code> command</li><li>decoupling from additional layers (NCLU)</li><li>avoid hybrid solutions since NCLU is not capable of solving all use cases completely (e.g. DHCP configuration)</li><li>in the past we made good experiences with rendering plain configuration files</li></ul><p>Of course this decision comes with the challenge to render all required files correctly and reload the appropriate services accordingly.</p><p>Reference: <a href="https://www.nvidia.com/en-us/networking/education/">Operationalizing Cumulus Linux</a></p><h3 id="PXE-Boot-Mode"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#PXE-Boot-Mode">PXE Boot Mode</a><a id="PXE-Boot-Mode-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#PXE-Boot-Mode" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>Before a bare metal server can act as tenant server or tenant firewall, it has to be provisioned. Within the Metal domain, this provisioning mode is called &quot;PXE Mode&quot; since it is based on Preboot eXecution Environment (PXE). PXE uses protocols like DHCP. This requires all bare metal servers that need provisioning to be located in a layer-2 domain where DHCP is available. This domain is a VLAN <code>vlan4000</code>. A DHCP server for PXE Mode is installed on the exit switches to work in this specific VLAN.</p><pre><code class="language-bash hljs"># /etc/default/isc-dhcp-server
INTERFACES=&quot;vlan4000&quot;</code></pre><blockquote><p>Listing 13: DHCP server configration of exit switches.</p></blockquote><p>As shown in listing 13, the PXE DHCP server is located on the exit switches and enforced to bind to interface <code>vlan4000</code>. This represents a layer-2 separation that allows only DHCP clients in the same VLAN to request IP addresses. Only unprovisionned bare metal servers are configured to be member of this VLAN. Thus unwanted or accidential provisionning is impossible.</p><p>To provide <code>vlan4000</code> on the leaves (that face the bare metal servers) the exit and leaf switches are configured as VTEPs and share an interface configuration that contains the required interfaces (Listing 13). Since no EVPN routing is in place <code>vni104000</code> is configured as an L2 VNI (there is no mapping for this VNI in <code>/etc/frr/frr.conf</code>).</p><pre><code class="language-bash hljs"># /etc/network/interfaces

This is because the exit switches are announced as DHCP gateway to the DHCP clients.</p><h3 id="Management-Network"><a class="docs-heading-anchor" href="#Management-Network">Management Network</a><a id="Management-Network-1"></a><a class="docs-heading-anchor-permalink" href="#Management-Network" title="Permalink"></a></h3><p>To manage network switches beside the out-of-band system console access a further management access is required. For this purpose the concept of <strong>Management VRF</strong> is applied. The Management VRF is a subset of VRF. It provides a separation between out-of-band management network and the in-band data plane network by introducing another routing table <strong>mgmt</strong>. Cumulus Linux supports eth0 to be used as the management interface.</p><p>To enable and use the Management VRF all switches have to be connected via their eth0 interface to a management-switch. The management switch is connected to a management server. All access is established from within the managment server. Logins to the switch are set into the Management VRF context once the Managment VRF is enabled.</p></article><nav class="docs-footer"><a class="docs-footer-prevpage" href="../architecture/">« Architecture</a><a class="docs-footer-nextpage" href="../hardware/">Hardware Support »</a><div class="flexbox-break"></div><p class="footer-message">Powered by <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> and the <a href="https://julialang.org/">Julia Programming Language</a>.</p></nav></div><div class="modal" id="documenter-settings"><div class="modal-background"></div><div class="modal-card"><header class="modal-card-head"><p class="modal-card-title">Settings</p><button class="delete"></button></header><section class="modal-card-body"><p><label class="label">Theme</label><div class="select"><select id="documenter-themepicker"><option value="documenter-light">documenter-light</option><option value="documenter-dark">documenter-dark</option></select></div></p><hr/><p>This document was generated with <a href="https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl">Documenter.jl</a> version 0.27.23 on <span class="colophon-date" title="Tuesday 13 June 2023 06:02">Tuesday 13 June 2023</span>.
